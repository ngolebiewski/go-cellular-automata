# Cellular Automata with Go

I'm quite interested in cellular automata, like John Conway's Game of Life, and Wolfram's Elementary Cellular Automaton and its 256 (yes, that's 8-bit) flavors: https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html . Also, I watched Daniel Shiffman's Coding Traing episode on 'CA', you should too! https://youtu.be/Ggxt06qSAe4?si=4EAnzvrtp9o_0MnS

I wanted to program in Go, and just print to the terminal. 

I ended up accidentally coding a Sierpinski triangle, named after the Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński. It's a "fractal with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles." -Wikipedia.

Also, after practicing some Python with Harvard's CS50P class and liking their problem sets with terminal/CLI animations on usage, I also wanted to try out asciinema to record this program running and turn it into a GIF for this readme. https://asciinema.org/

Run on your own.
1. Install Go if needed, check out: https://go.dev/doc/install
2. Clone this repo in a directory of your choice. Grab the link from the <>Code button here on Github. SSH is `git clone git@github.com:ngolebiewski/go-cellular-automata.git`
3. In your Terminal write `$ go run .`
